Open materials for teaching introductory Cryptography for High School
students, developed for [Cyberwars at UVA Camp

Introduction to Cryptography: [Annotated Slides (PPTX)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pey81ah1myykgj2/cryptointro-annotated.pptx?dl=0)

[`jeffersonwheel/substitution.py`](https://github.com/evansuva/cipherschool/blob/master/jeffersonwheel/substitution.py) - simple monoalphabetic substitution cipher  
[`jeffersonwheel/jeffersonwheel.py`](https://github.com/evansuva/cipherschool/blob/master/jeffersonwheel/jeffersonwheel.py) - code for Jefferson's Wheel Cypher

The `wheelcypher.pptx` is a PowerPoint file with a generated wheel key
that can be printed on a double-sided printer and cut into rings that
fit around a water bottle to make a model wheel cipher machine.

## Visual Cryptography and Perfect Ciphers

[`visualcrypto/explanation.pptx`](https://github.com/evansuva/cipherschool/blob/master/visualcrypto/explanation.pptx) - shows the two different ways to encode each bit.  

[`visualcrypto/visualcrypto.py`](https://github.com/evansuva/cipherschool/blob/master/visualcrypto/visualcrypto.py) - Python code for generating keys and transparencies. See the comments in the code for how to use.
